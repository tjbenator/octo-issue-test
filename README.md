Testing Github's Issue template functionality

# Tests
This [article](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue-template-for-your-repository/) on creating issue templates has multiple different locations and naming schemes listed, most of which do not work. The screenshots are also inconsistant with what the text is saying.

Here are the different locations I've tried in this repo. On each commit I have submitted an issue on this repo. If you see "**Can you see me now?**" on the issue page then it was a success.

**Working:**
* ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
* issue_template.md
* .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
* .github/issue_template.md

**Not Working:**
* docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
* docs/issue_template.md
* issue-template.md

**Haven't Tried:**
* ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md
* issue-template.md
* .github/ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md
* .github/issue-template.md
* docs/ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md
* docs/issue-template.md
